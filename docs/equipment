**SkyLight: 'most pieces arent hard to get'
**SkyLight: 'need ornaments from christmas quests'
**SkyLight: '+1 cast speed'
**SkyLight: 'a piece'
You grouptell: and then +4 from equ?
**SkyLight: '+5 from eq'
**Pif: '4 if you take it to rank 11'
**SkyLight: 'most of it will be mana regen'
**SkyLight: 'why is it only 4?'
**Pif: 'because the overall max is 15'
You grouptell: hmmm christmas quests will be hard (for a few months at least :) )
**SkyLight: 'i MIGHT have extras'
**SkyLight: 'but thats a big MIGHT'
You grouptell: *hug*
**SkyLight: 'if i need more ill just run the quest on some bloods again'
**SkyLight: 'also another piece is from seasons'
**SkyLight: 'also another +1 cast speed piece'
**SkyLight: 'but its not hard'
**SkyLight: 'easy peasy'
You grouptell: :)
**SkyLight: 'i duo'd to get mine because i needed a small amount of heals toward the end'
**SkyLight: 'ran out of mana to wio'
**SkyLight: 'stoddard something'
**SkyLight: 'sleeves of stoddard or something like that'
You grouptell: ahhh seen people wearing those

**SkyLight: 'i prefer those over universe personally'
**SkyLight: 'helm of the spell caster'
**SkyLight: 'eternal flame'
**SkyLight: 'mirror boots +1 heal'

You grouptell: sweet
**SkyLight: 'fallen angel wing is prolly the hardest piece hehe'
**SkyLight: 'which is saying a lot because thats a joke as well'
You grouptell: hahaha
**SkyLight: 'unless you wanna count RNG'
**SkyLight: 'which then it would be the shield because its a random drop from mines'
**Atropa: 'There ya go, shield :)'
**SkyLight: 'well'
**SkyLight: 'there ya go'
**SkyLight: 'theres your hardest piece hehehehehe'
You grouptell: wooot!
**SkyLight: 'weapon sucks might as well just say f the weapons'
**SkyLight: 'staff of the spell caster is a mana drain but it sucks'
**Atropa: 'dual shield prophet, mmmm'

**SkyLight: 'dual shield would be 1,000x better than the staff'
**SkyLight: 'silver or golden apple but thats not really needed'
**SkyLight: 'its only +1 mana regen'
**SkyLight: 'from sand witch'
You grouptell: ok
**SkyLight: 'also RNG and i dont even know if you can even get those anymore'
**SkyLight: 'leggings of tatanya or however you spell that b' name'
**SkyLight: 'pretty much you should end with +4 cast speed, +5 heal, and +180 mana regen but i think that might be including vigor'
**SkyLight: 'is where i got moonlight to'
You grouptell: that aint bad!
**SkyLight: 'oh you did go with trog though'
**SkyLight: 'trogs not bad but eldar gets a massive mana regen bonus'
**SkyLight: 'after playing a healer centaur i wanna go back to eldar'
You grouptell: was trog back in 4.0, guess i can change it
**SkyLight: 'ehh wouldnt waste the qpts'
**SkyLight: 'think its like 30'
**SkyLight: 'not worth it'
<Gossip: Ivy> 'morning'
You grouptell: so spend qpts on maxskills instead?
**SkyLight: 'nod'
**SkyLight: 'gonna need a lot'
**SkyLight: 'if youre gonna maxrank heal and call lightning'
<Gossip: Atropa> 'mornin' Ives!'
**SkyLight: 'now if you were going straight heals, i think you can get that with only 1 set of characters qpts'
**SkyLight: 'but to do call lightning as well youre definitely gonna need some more qpts than just one character'
**SkyLight: 'unless you find a lot of shard hehe :P'
You grouptell: hehe
**SkyLight: 'feathered earrings'
**SkyLight: 'i do believe'
**SkyLight: 'crystal lense'
**SkyLight: 'you can prolly make better than armor than what i got'
<Gossip: Puff> 'I think I'd be really good at hanging mirrors, you know, I can really see myself doing that.'
**SkyLight: 'im just using white albs but its only +1 heal'
**SkyLight: 'might be able to craft a piece that has +1 heal and something else'
**SkyLight: 'even if that something else is something stupid'
**SkyLight: 'still better than nothing'
**SkyLight: 'although for prophet pieces i think you have to get cloth'
**SkyLight: 'which ive never done that before'
You grouptell: me neihter
**SkyLight: 'ive done skinning, bones, herbs, and fishing so far'
**SkyLight: 'fishing is kinda lit'
**SkyLight: 'but going to wilderness'
You grouptell: how does it work, stand in a stream?
**SkyLight: 'nahh same as others'
You grouptell: or is it gather like herbs
You grouptell: ahh ok
**Atropa: 'like herbs'
**SkyLight: 'nod'
**SkyLight: 'but they sell for decent price'
**SkyLight: 'but again WILDERNESS'
<Gossip: Puff> 'Liminal has killed soooo many of my friends!'
You grouptell: well need to go there someday and kill the Terrible Terrasque :)
**SkyLight: 'and youre level 100 and prophet so that makes for a mess in wilderness'
**SkyLight: 'its tough to even find him or her or whatever it is'
You grouptell: which charmies would be best there?
**SkyLight: 'you'll die before finding it'
You grouptell: better bring a group then :)
**SkyLight: 'nod'
**SkyLight: 'at least a tanker'
You grouptell: is there a max on charm person? or can that be boosted with maxskills as well?
**SkyLight: 'there is a max of 2 charmies i do believe'
**SkyLight: 'at least was when i was doing charm'
**Atropa: 'Not sure additional maxranks would help'
You grouptell: nod, but was thinking on allowed charm level
**Atropa: 'I believe that's a hard-cap'
**SkyLight: 'might help level'
**SkyLight: 'shrug cant say ive used it a fair enough amount to judge it'
**Atropa: 'Nothing higher than 75 can be enchanted or something, someone else might need to confirm but I _think_ that's right.'
**Atropa: 'err, charmed'
You grouptell: :)
#SESSION 'com' ACTIVATED.
**SkyLight: 'limits on a prophet are something that you will have to learn'
**SkyLight: 'even with 10k hp youre squishy'
**SkyLight: 'no real ac or defense to really back you up'
**SkyLight: 'so youre feeling the brunt of every swing'
**SkyLight: 'and dont think range is gonna save you hehe'
**SkyLight: 'higher level mobs laugh at range'
**Atropa: 'That's what charmies are for, grab the captain from midgaard castle or whatever, mmmm'
**Atropa: 'midgaard palace'
**SkyLight: 'im just talking in general'
**Atropa: 'nod'
**SkyLight: 'charmies do help a lot'
